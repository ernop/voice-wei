### Questions

1. **Are there other common mishearings for note names?**
   - Does "see" sometimes get heard as something else?
   - What about accented speech patterns?

2. **Should we add number-based note names?**
   - Some systems use 1-7 for scale degrees
   - "Play 5" for the 5th note?

3. **Regional variations?**
   - UK vs US pronunciation differences?
   - "Solfege" names (do, re, mi) as aliases?

## Other Open Questions

4. **Scale naming conventions**
   - "Hungarian minor" vs "double harmonic" - should both work?
   - "Natural minor" as alias for "minor"?

5. **Default behaviors**
   - When user says just "again" with no previous command, should we:
     - Show error (current)?
     - Play a default scale?
     - Do nothing silently?
